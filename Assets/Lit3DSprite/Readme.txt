To use the Shader included in this package, simply create a material and 
assign the "Lit3dSprite" shader to it.

Any texture can be used with the shader and you can adjust the fill color
set the alpha cut-off using the slider.

Any material using the shader will receive unity lighting correctly and
display the texture bi-directionally, allowing you to create true two-sided
sprites and still use Unity's lighting, including light-cookie, system.
